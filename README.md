# RaboBank_Dataset

Banking Transaction Dataset: Please contact authors for the complete dataset.

Dataset details: The dataset contains anonymized records of bank accounts and transactions within Rabobank over an 11-year period from 2010 to 2020. For every pair of accounts with at least one transaction, the data includes the number of transactions and the total amount of money transferred between them. In total, the dataset covers 1,624,030 bank accounts and 4,127,043 transactions, represented as (from account, to account) pairs. Two weighted network representations are provided: (i) GT Network: The edge weight represents the total money transferred between two accounts, and (ii) GN Network: The edge weight represents the total number of transactions between two accounts. More details are explained in "The Banking Transactions Dataset and its Comparative Analysis with Scale-free Networks" paper.
